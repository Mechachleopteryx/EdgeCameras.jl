  abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of reproducing the world lighting from a single image of an object covered with random specular microfacets on the surface. We show that such reflectors can be interpreted as a randomized mapping from the lighting to the image. Such specular objects have very different optical properties from both diffuse surfaces and smooth specular objects like metals, so we design special imaging system to robustly and effectively photograph them. We present simple yet reliable algorithms to calibrate the proposed system and do the inference. We conduct experiments to verify the correctness of our model assumptions and prove the effectiveness of our pipeline.},

  title = {Random {{Lens Imaging}}},
  abstract = {We call a random lens one for which the function relating the input light ray to the output sensor location is pseudo-random. Imaging systems with random lensescan expand the space of possible camera designs, allowing new trade-offs in optical design and potentially adding new imaging capabilities. Machine learningmethods are critical for both camera calibration and image reconstruction from the sensor data. We develop the theory and compare two different methods for calibration and reconstruction: an MAP approach, and basis pursuit from compressive sensing. We show proof-of-concept experimental results from a random lens made from a multi-faceted mirror, showing successful calibration and image reconstruction. We illustrate the potential for super-resolution and 3D imaging.},

  title = {Eyes for {{Relighting}}},
  doi = {10.1145/1186562.1015783},
  abstract = {The combination of the cornea of an eye and a camera viewing the eye form a catadioptric (mirror + lens) imaging system with a very wide field of view. We present a detailed analysis of the characteristics of this corneal imaging system. Anatomical studies have shown that the shape of a normal cornea (without major defects) can be approximated with an ellipsoid of fixed eccentricity and size. Using this shape model, we can determine the geometric parameters of the corneal imaging system from the image. Then, an environment map of the scene with a large field of view can be computed from the image. The environment map represents the illumination of the scene with respect to the eye. This use of an eye as a natural light probe is advantageous in many relighting scenarios. For instance, it enables us to insert virtual objects into an image such that they appear consistent with the illumination of the scene. The eye is a particularly useful probe when relighting faces. It allows us to reconstruct the geometry of a face by simply waving a light source in front of the face. Finally, in the case of an already captured image, eyes could be the only direct means for obtaining illumination information. We show how illumination computed from eyes can be used to replace a face in an image with another one. We believe that the eye not only serves as a useful tool for relighting but also makes relighting possible in situations where current approaches are hard to use.},
