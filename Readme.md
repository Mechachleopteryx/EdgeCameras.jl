# EdgeCameras.jl: Edge Cameras in Julia

This project consists of an implementation of *edge cameras* based on the work of Bouman et al. [1]. An edge camera is formed when a sharp edge (such as the corner of a wall) creates a natural one-dimensonal pinhole camera, revealing the motions of objects which are completely obscured by the corner. More information from the original authors can be found at [people.csail.mit.edu](https://people.csail.mit.edu/klbouman/cornercameras.html). 

This package consists of an entirely new implementation of the edge camera algorithm, based on the work presented in the paper, and done entirely in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) (except for the raw video I/O, which is ultimately handled by `ffmpeg`).
